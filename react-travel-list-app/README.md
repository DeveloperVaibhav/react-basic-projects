**⚛️ React Concepts Used**

<br>

▸ Functional Components – UI is broken into reusable components.

▸ JSX – HTML-like syntax used to build dynamic UI.

▸ useState Hook – Manages application state (items list, packed status).

▸ Props – Passing data and functions between parent and child components.

▸ Event Handling – Handling user actions like add, delete, and toggle items.

▸ Controlled Components – Form inputs controlled via React state.

▸ List Rendering – Rendering dynamic lists using map().

▸ Conditional Rendering – Displaying UI elements based on application state.

<br>

**✨ Key Features**

<br>

▸ Add new items to the travel packing list.

▸ Mark items as packed / unpacked.

▸ Delete items from the list.

▸ Display real-time packing statistics.

▸ Simple and responsive user interface.
